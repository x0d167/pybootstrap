## üöÄ How to Run

> ‚ö° Important: This script assumes a clean Fedora install, and will modify your system configuration.

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open a terminal in the `pybootstrap/` directory
3. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
4. Run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

‚úÖ Done! The system will walk through each setup stage automatically and log it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

- This script assumes **you want opinionated defaults** for directory layout, security, and installed packages.
- You should review the `scripts/` and `config/` folders first if you want to customize.
- While it _should_ be safe, **always have a backup** before using automation like this on a fresh system.

---

## üß† Notes

- Fedora is assumed, but could be adapted to other RPM-based distros.
- Some error handling is intentionally light ‚Äî this is designed for **personal use**, not public distribution.
- After bootstrap, you should manually configure:
  - rkhunter
  - lynis
  - any desktop environment tweaks
